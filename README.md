# Mechatronics System Design Lecture Final Project
This Mechatronics System Design repository is built for Shared Autonomous Car project in scope of Mechatronics System Design course
Project team members are:
  1. İbrahim Ekin Çoban
  2. Mehmet Erkut Çelik
  3. Batuhan Gökten
# Project Scope and Shared Autonomus Car Features
The project car features as shown below:
  1. Trajectory Planning
  2. Object Detection and Classifying
  3. SLAM (Simulataneous Localization and Mapping)
  4. Line Detecting
 
 # Project Study Summary
 1. During the process ROS and Ubuntu OS are mainly used for the project. 
 2. Simulation environment is designed in Gazebo. 
 3. SLAM algorithm ROS packages, Pure Pursuit Control and Trajectory Planning ROS packages are used in order to provide the success criterias.
 4. Rviz is the main program for simulation and visualization purposes.
 5. YOLOv4 and Darknet algorithms are used for object classification and object detection.
 6. Pre-trained models are used for object detection and Google Colab was the main tool for video and image inputs.
 7. Simple lane detecting algorithm was written in python with OpenCV and Numpy libraries.
